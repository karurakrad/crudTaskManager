# Proyect 2: CRUD - Task Manager

This project is a Task Manager (CRUD) developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, assign priorities, and display corresponding background colors. Additionally, tasks are stored locally for persistence.

As for the creative idea, it is intended to work as a visual portfolio for an interior design studio so that it is as clean as possible and with cool colors to highlight the images presented.

Here you can see the simple prototype of the project.
